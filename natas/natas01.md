# OverTheWire Natas — Level 1

## Objective

Retrieve the password for the next level from a webpage where the right-click functionality has been disabled.

## Access

* URL: http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
* Username: natas1
* Password: 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq

## Method

The page implements a client-side JavaScript restriction that blocks the context menu (right-click). To bypass this, view the source code using alternative browser functions, such as the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+U`) or by prepending `view-source:` to the URL.

## Result

Password for the next level obtained successfully.

## Key Takeaway

* Disabling right-click is a user interface obstruction, not a security control.
* Browsers provide multiple independent ways to access the source code.
