# OverTheWire Bandit - Capture The Flag (CTF) Write-ups

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my personal write-ups, documentation, and solutions for the **OverTheWire Bandit** wargame. The Bandit series is designed to teach the fundamentals of Linux system administration, command-line interaction, and essential security concepts.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to document the learning process, demonstrate proficiency in Linux environments, and provide clear, systematic solutions for each level from **Level 0 to Level 26**.

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Learned
Throughout these challenges, I have utilized and mastered various tools and concepts, including:

* **Remote Access & Auth:** `ssh`, SSH keys, bypassing restricted shells.
* **File Manipulation:** `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `diff`, `base64`, `gzip`, `tar`.
* **Network Reconnaissance:** `nmap`, `nc` (Netcat), `openssl s_client`, port scanning.
* **System Administration:** Analyzing Cron jobs, SUID/GUID permissions, file ownership.
* **Scripting & Automation:** Bash scripting, loops, and automating brute-force attacks.

## 📂 Level Progression

| Level Range | Status | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Level 00 → 10** | ✅ Completed | Basic commands, hidden files, data types |
| **Level 11 → 14** | ✅ Completed | Encoding (Base64/ROT13), SSH keys |
| **Level 14 → 17** | ✅ Completed | Networking, SSL/TLS, Port Scanning |
| **Level 17 → 20** | ✅ Completed | File diffing, SUID binaries, Shell escape |
| **Level 20 → 24** | ✅ Completed | Network listeners, Cron job exploitation |
| **Level 24 → 26** | ✅ Completed | Brute-forcing PINs, Vim shell escape |
