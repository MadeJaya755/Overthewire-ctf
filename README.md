## Documentation Approach

This repository documents each OverTheWire level using structured write-ups supported by visual evidence where appropriate.

Screenshots are used selectively to:
- Illustrate command execution and terminal output
- Support key steps in the problem-solving process
- Improve clarity of technical explanations

Each screenshot is accompanied by written context explaining the reasoning and actions taken, rather than relying on images alone.
## Visual Evidence Handling

Some write-ups include screenshots (e.g., terminal output) as part of the documentation.  
To maintain security best practices:

- Sensitive information such as passwords, private keys, and tokens is **redacted or omitted**
- Screenshots are used only to support understanding, not to expose credentials
- Private key files or raw secrets are **never committed** to the repository

This approach ensures the repository remains safe, professional, and suitable for public viewing.

## Notes

This repository prioritizes clear explanations, structured documentation, and security hygiene.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical understanding and problem-solving methodology rather than simply presenting solutions.
