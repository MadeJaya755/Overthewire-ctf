# OverTheWire Wargames — Security Practice Documentation

This repository contains structured technical documentation of my work on **OverTheWire Wargames**, focused on demonstrating real understanding of security fundamentals rather than listing raw commands or copied solutions.

All activities documented here were performed **exclusively in legal wargame/CTF environments** provided by OverTheWire.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Build a solid **attacker mindset** through hands-on practice
* Strengthen **core security fundamentals** (Linux, authentication, cryptography, web security)
* Provide **clear, reviewable technical documentation** suitable for recruiters and senior security engineers

This repository is **not a shortcut guide**. It is written for readers who care about methodology, reasoning, and learning outcomes.

## 🧠 Completed Wargames

The following OverTheWire wargames have been fully completed and documented:

* **Bandit** — *Completed up to level 26*
  Focus: Linux basics, SSH, file handling, permissions, basic scripting

* **Natas** — *Completed up to level 26*
  Focus: Web security, authentication flaws, injection, logic vulnerabilities

* **Leviathan** — *Completed (all levels)*
  Focus: Basic binary exploitation and privilege escalation concepts

* **Krypton** — *Completed (all levels)*
  Focus: Classical cryptography weaknesses and cryptanalysis

The structure is intentionally kept clean to ensure:

* Easy navigation
* Clear level-by-level progression
* Readable and auditable documentation

---

## 🧩 Documentation Format

Each level is documented using a consistent structure:

* **Objective**
* **Access / Credentials**
* **Enumeration**
* **Exploitation**
* **Result**
* **Key Takeaways**

Documentation without takeaways is considered incomplete.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* Passwords and flags may change over time
* The focus of this repository is **methodology and reasoning**, not secrets
* Blind copy-paste defeats the purpose of learning

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

In real-world security work, memorizing commands is irrelevant.
What matters:

* How you think
* How you analyze problems
* How clearly you document your findings

A security practitioner who cannot write proper documentation is only half effective.

---

## 📌 Status

* Progress: Actively maintained
* Documentation is continuously reviewed and refined

---

If you are reviewing this repository as a recruiter or security engineer: yes, the tone is intentional. Clarity beats decoration.
